# Sorting

The following folder contains a project displaying examples of the following sorting algorithms:

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Heap Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort

The purpose for sorting data is to arrange them into meaningful order to analyze more effictively.
For this example, reorganizing an external file containing test scores that need to be arrange from
the lowest to highest scores. Although any sorting algorithm can be used to complete the task, some
may be preferable than others. Large data input may require faster sorting such as Quick and Heap 
sort, while small data requires less work such as Bubble sort. For any situtation, there will be a 
sorting algorithm that is the optimal choice.
