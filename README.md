# Algorithms Portfolio
Hello! My name is Evangelina Avila, but I prefer to go by Evy! I'm a student attending
Columbia College Chicago majoring in Game Programming and minoring in Game Design. 
Over the span of the 2022 Fall semester at Columbia College Chicago, I have learned 
different aspects in Algorithms. This portofolio is to showcase my understanding of weekly 
topics. The examples used for the projects are based on my personal interest. For example, 
I use music related information as values since I've played and studied music for over 10 years. 
I've also used video game titles since I enjoy playing them. It's a way of combining things I enjoy 
into Algorithms.
