# Data Structures 

The following folder contains two project examples of the use of Data Structures. The first 
folder compares Arrays and Maps while the second folder compares Stacks and Queues. 
Each example stores large data from an external text file of video game titles. The purpose
of the projects is to compare how each implementation is different and which is more
efficient based on circumstances. 

While implementing the applications, they each follow the same format of retrieving the data
from a text file and setting the values into the containment types of Arrays, Dictionarys, 
Stacks, and Queues. Then, the console displays the entire data.
