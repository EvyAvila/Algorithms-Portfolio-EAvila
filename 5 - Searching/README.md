# Searching

The following folder contains a project displaying examples of the following searching algorithms:

* Linear
    - [Linear Description]()
* Binary
    - [Binary Description]()
* Interpolation
    - [Interpolation Description]()

The purpose for searching is to location an element in a data structure. From the three searches,
Linear is the slowest with having to go through every single element in the data. As for Binary
and Interpolation, they are faster in regards to going through a specific location, but only when
they are sorted. What makes them unique is where the starting position is; the middle for Binary
or closest value for Interpolation.
