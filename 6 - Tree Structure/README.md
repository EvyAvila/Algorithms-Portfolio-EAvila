# Tree Structure

The following folder contains a project displaying an example of Tree Structure 
using Binary Search Tree.

* Binary Search Tree Structure
    - [Example](https://github.com/EvyAvila/Algorithms-Portfolio-EAvila/blob/main/6%20-%20Tree%20Structure/TreeExample/TreeExample/BinarySearchTree.cs)

A tree is an organization of values in a hierarchy called nodes. There is a root that
starts the tree, and children that fall underneath. If the children of the node has 
children, then they are the partent's of their child nodes. 
As for Binary Search Tree, each node can only have the max of two children that
are placed on the left or right side of the tree. It's determined on the size of the node
from the key value that is being compared. For example, if the next node from the
root is a smaller number, it's placed on the left side of the tree. If the next node 
afterwards is greater than the root, it's placed on the right side of the tree. To visit the
nodes inside the tree, it uses three types of traversals called Pre-Order, In-Order,
and Post-Order.
