# Big O Notation

The following folder contain three project examples of the Big O Notation.
Big O Notation is the language used for discussing how long an algorithm 
takes to run. It compares the efficiency of different approaches to a problem.

Each folder is its own example of Big O Notation, from:
*Linear O(1)
*Constant O(n)
*Quadratic O(n^2)
