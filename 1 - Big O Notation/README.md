# Big O Notation

The following folder contain three project examples of the Big O Notation.
Big O Notation is the language used for discussing how long an algorithm 
takes to run. It compares the efficiency of different approaches to a problem.

Each folder is its own example of Big O Notation, from:
* Linear O(1)
   - In this project, I create a small string array called ComposerList that contains
     a few items. A method called PrintMusicComposerCatalogueName takes a string
     array parameter. The purpose of the method is to display any name inside the array.

* Constant O(n)
   - Similar to the Linear project, it contains an array of integers called Metronome with
     a several values. A method called PrintMetronomeMakings takes in an integer array and
     uses a For Loop. Each time the loop occures, the application displays the metronome 
     markings. 

* Quadratic O(n^2)
   - Finally, this project contains two integer arrays called TopNum and BottomNum with
     a variety of values inserted. A method called PrintTimeSignature was created which takes
     two interger array parameters. Inside the method contains two loops. The first loop goes
     through the bottomNumber array while the second loop goes through the topNumber.
    
If further explanations are needed, all the projects contain a small paragraph explaining the purpose.
