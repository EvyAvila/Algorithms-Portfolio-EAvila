# Fisher-Yates Shuffle

The following folder contain two project examples of the use of Fisher-Yates Shuffle.
Fisher-Yates Shuffle is an algorithm that creates a random permutation of a finite
sequence. 

The first file called **Fisher-YatesShuffleMyExample** is my own creation that uses
the algorithm from an external text data file. I also created a Library to contain the important 
classes. To transfer the data from the file to a containment, I experimented having a class to 
extract the external file into a List containment. I decided to use a List to hold the data and
conduct the shuffle because it would be more dynamic than an array. For swapping the 
positions and shuffling the containment, the commands had to be altered in order to function.

Inside the project are comments for every field and method that further explain their functions
and purpose.
