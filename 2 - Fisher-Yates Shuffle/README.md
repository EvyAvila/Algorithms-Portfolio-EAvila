# Fisher-Yates Shuffle

The following folder contain two project examples of the use of Fisher-Yates Shuffle.
Fisher-Yates Shuffle is an algorithm that creates a random permutation of a finite
sequence. 

The first file called **Fisher-YatesShuffleMyExample** is my own creation that uses
the algorithm from an external text data file. To transfer the data from the file to a containment,
I decided to use a List to hold the data and conduct the shuffle.
